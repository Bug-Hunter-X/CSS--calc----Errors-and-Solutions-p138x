The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but there might be unexpected results if the units are inconsistent or if there are syntax errors.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works correctly, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely result in an error because the unit is missing from the second term.  Another issue can arise if you try to nest `calc()` functions improperly.  For instance, `height: calc(calc(50% - 10px) + 20px);` is not valid syntax; you should simplify the calculation into a single `calc()` function.
